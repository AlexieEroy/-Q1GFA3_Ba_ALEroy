                <h3>From our data, the histogram of the number of allergies a student has is skewed to the right, meaning the majority of our data is on the lower end. We can conclude that the majority of our batch has no allergies. Although the majority have no allergies, the most common number of allergies a student has is 2. From our data, we can also see that most of the students who answered our forms are from section Barium and are of female gender while the least amount of data are from section Sodium and are of male gender. We were also able to conclude that the majority of our batchmates are 14 years old.</h3>
                <p><h3>Our data is a sample, meaning the data collected are from a subgroup of the entire population. If we were to collect the data of the entire Batch 2027, our data sets, graphs, and conclusions may be different. In our following research, we will aim to have the whole batch participate in our research to be able to come up with an accurate data set and conclusion.</h3></p>
